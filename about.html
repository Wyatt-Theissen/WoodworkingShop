      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Wyatt, and I'm a high school student with a passion for woodworking sparked by FFA.</p>
      <p>Thanks to my uncle’s woodworking barn here in Monrovia, I have access to quality hardwoods and the tools to bring ideas to life. My uncle generously supplies the wood and space, letting me focus on creating unique, handcrafted cutting boards and more.</p>
      <p>We don’t charge extra for woods such as walnut or cedar because we believe great quality should be accessible. Every board is made with the best wood available at prices that can't be beat by today's market.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a simple board or a custom piece shaped like your home state, each creation is a reflection of our love for the craft and commitment to quality.</p>
      <p>Thank you for supporting my small woodworking business.</p>

      <h2>The Woodworking Process</h2>
      <p>Our process begins with selecting the finest hardwoods from local sources, primarily supplied by my uncle’s woodworking barn. Each board is carefully cut, shaped, sanded, and finished by hand to ensure quality and durability.</p>
      <p>We focus on traditional craftsmanship with a modern touch, combining precision tools with personal attention to detail. Every step is done thoughtfully to create boards that not only look beautiful but last for years.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We believe quality craftsmanship should be accessible and sustainable. By using wood supplied freely by our trusted barn and keeping prices fair, we provide exceptional value without cutting corners.</p>
      <p>We don’t charge extra for exotic woods like walnut or cedar, because to us, quality shouldn’t come with a premium price tag.</p>
      <p>Every board is made with respect for the wood and our customers.</p>
