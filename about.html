      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Wyatt, and woodworking is more than just a craft — it’s family and tradition.</p>
      <p>Thanks to my uncle’s woodworking barn here in Indiana, I have access to quality hardwoods and the tools to bring ideas to life. My uncle generously supplies the wood and space, letting me focus on creating unique, handcrafted cutting boards and more.</p>
      <p>We don’t charge extra for exotic woods like walnut or quarter-sawn sycamore because we believe great quality should be accessible. Every board is made with care, precision, and a passion for woodworking.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a simple board or a custom piece shaped like your home state, each creation is a reflection of our love for the craft and dedication to customers.</p>
      <p>Thank you for supporting a small woodworking business with big heart.</p>
