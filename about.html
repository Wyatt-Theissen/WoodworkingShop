      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Wyatt, and I'm a high school student with a passion for woodworking sparked by FFA.</p>
      <p>Thanks to my uncle’s woodworking barn here in Monrovia, I have access to quality hardwoods and the tools to bring ideas to life. My uncle generously supplies the wood and space, letting me focus on creating unique, handcrafted cutting boards and more.</p>
      <p>We don’t charge extra for woods such as walnut or cedar because we believe great quality should be accessible. Every board is made with the best wood available at prices that can't be beat by today's market.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a simple board or a custom piece shaped like your home state, each creation is a reflection of our love for the craft and commitment to quality.</p>
      <p>Thank you for supporting my small woodworking business.</p>
